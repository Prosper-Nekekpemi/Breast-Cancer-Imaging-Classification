# Breast-Cancer-Imaging-Classification

## Project Overview
This project focuses on using machine learning to classify breast ultrasound images into three categories: normal, benign, and malignant. Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women globally, and early detection through medical imaging can help reduce mortality rates. Ultrasound imaging is a non-invasive technique that is widely used for breast cancer screening and diagnosis.

By training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using pre-trained ResNet-18, this project aims to classify breast ultrasound images into these three categories with high accuracy. The project leverages transfer learning to fine-tune the ResNet model for this task.
